  <h1>Welcome to Let's Boost It!</h1>
  <h2>If you're trying to improve your Internet connectivity performance, you're in the right place to be!</h2>
  <h3>You reached the home of the Booster project.</h3>

  <p>We want to <span class="highlight">improve our network connectivity</span> by finally having a <span
      class="highlight">plug-and-play</span> solution that allows us to take full
    advantage of our mobile devices! <span class="highlight">We believe in the strength of collaboration</span>, and we
    apply the very same concept to
    devices, this time with the focus on Internet connectivity.</p>

  <p>We're building a <span class="highlight">new multi-homed router device</span>, which will replace your current home
    router or extend it. The router will provide ports for connecting the mobile devices to it, and interfaces for
    connecting the devices that need to be.. boosted.</p>
  <p>Among our early adopters and testers we have <span class="bold">gamers</span>, which thrive for a reliable access
    point which reserves a slice of the overall bandwidth available for a smooth gaming experience. We have <span
      class="highlight">professional photographers</span>, which want to upload their pictures overnight and need a
    reliable link that will not let the upload interrupt, or last too long. We have also <span class="highlight">people
      that just want to watch Netflix together</span>, splitting the data download consumption equally.</p>

  <p>If you want to learn more, our <a href="https://forum.letsboost.it">forum</a> is the perfect place to land to!
    You'll find technical and non-technical information.</p>
